This project is about creating a library fill with books.
The aim is to add a book with some details about the book like title, author, number of pages and if the book have been read or not.
There will be an option to  delete books and edith there read status.
With this project i will learn how to create and add items with details or descriptions that can be reused in part or whole.
Even though there may be other methods of doing this, I will be using objects in Javascript for this project. This will be my first project after learning Javascript Objects. It may not look great but i will give it my best.
